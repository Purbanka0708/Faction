    review: `When I think about my JEE Advanced journey, one name stands out — Soumyadeep Dada. He wasn't just a physics teacher; he was my Jeetu Bhaiya, an elder brother who genuinely cared about my success.

Dada had a gift for simplifying complex concepts and making physics feel intuitive. Whether it was mechanics, electromagnetism, or modern physics, he made everything achievable. His passion was infectious, and every class felt like discovering the beauty of problem-solving together.

Beyond academics, Dada was there for the emotional journey too. He believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, offering support during the toughest moments of prep. He treated us not as students, but as younger siblings he was invested in.

Dada didn't just teach physics — he taught resilience and curiosity. His guidance shaped not just how I approached problems, but how I approached life.

I will always be grateful to Soumyadeep Dada for being my mentor, motivator, elder brother, and the reason I fell in love with physics.`,

    review: `I had the privilege of studying Physics at Faction Institute under the guidance of Soumyadeep Dada during my JEE preparation, and it was truly a transformative experience.

The conceptual clarity, problem-solving techniques, and structured approach towards JEE-level questions helped me build a strong foundation in Physics. Dada made even the most challenging topics feel intuitive and engaging.

Regular doubt-clearing sessions and practice tests ensured I stayed on track and kept improving. What stood out the most was the personal attention and motivation provided throughout the journey. Whenever I felt demotivated or stuck, he was always there to help.

I’m genuinely grateful for the guidance and support I received here, which played a crucial role in my JEE journey.`,

    review: `My journey with Soumyadeep Dada during my JEE days was incredible. He was simultaneously a mentor, motivator, and a guiding force.

The way he taught the toughest chapters of Physics — whether Rotational Mechanics or Ray Optics — was exceptional. Every topic was explained in depth, in a way that even an average student could understand clearly.

His hard work, dedication, and constant motivation throughout my JEE journey helped me reach the position I am in today.`,

    review: `My journey with Faction began during the lockdown through online classes by Niladri Sir. Initially, I disliked biology and found it boring, but after just one class, my perception started to change.

He explained concepts in our local language, making biology feel familiar and engaging. Even though I wasn’t a topper and my marks were average, I began to enjoy studying — which meant everything to me.

NEET was never my goal initially, but Niladri Sir believed in me and pushed me consistently. When Physics became a challenge, he introduced me to Soumyadeep Dada — and that changed everything.

Dada made my concepts crystal clear and motivated me like no one else. Writing our names on the screen for correct answers may seem small, but it meant the world to me.

Niladri Sir and Soumyadeep Dada became my guiding lights. Because of their belief and support, I am now pursuing a respected medical degree — something I never imagined for myself.`,

    review: `I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Faction for guiding me with dedication, clarity, and patience throughout my NEET journey.

The commitment of the mentors went far beyond the syllabus. Every concept, every fact, and even the smallest doubts were addressed with care. They provided not just strategies, but constant emotional and academic support.

Each one of them played a crucial role in shaping not only my preparation, but also the kind of student and person I’ve become.

Whatever I achieve in the future, I’ll always carry their lessons with me.`,
