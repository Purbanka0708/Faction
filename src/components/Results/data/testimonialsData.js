    review: `The only constants in my JEE Journey was me xd , my parents , quizzing and Soumyadeep Dada . Yeah I don’t call him sir ,  Dada feels like more close to home . I was never constant in my JEE preparation but whenever I had any doubts , Dada was there to help me . Transforming my fear of physics to love for it . The fun we had in having quizzes , to find out who can attempt the questions in the shortest possible time was pure nostalgia . The JEE journey was great but having Dada always by my side made it ultimate . Thank you for everything !`,

    review: `Preparing for JEE is a long and challenging journey, and having the right guidance can make all the difference. For me, Soumyadeep Sir played an important role in shaping my understanding of Physics. His teaching was clear, structured, and focused on building strong concepts rather than just solving problems mechanically.

What I appreciated most was his ability to simplify complex topics and present them in a way that actually made sense. Whether it was mechanics or electromagnetism, his approach helped me develop both clarity and confidence.

While my interactions with him were mostly within the classroom setting and the coaching centre, his consistent support, well-designed DPPs, and methodical revision strategies were key parts of my preparation. His classes gave me the push I needed to steadily improve and perform better with time.
I’m thankful for the role he played in my JEE journey and for helping me strengthen one of the most crucial subjects in the exam.`,

    review: `Reflecting upon my journey from a struggling aspirant to a proud IITian, one name that stands out above all is that of Er. Soumyadeep Nandi – my Physics Faculty, but more than a faculty he was like a big brother to me. During our classes we called him ”DADA” instead of “SIR” which explains lot in itself what was our relationship with him. I first met Er. Nandi in the latter part of my 11th standard. Although he was my school senior and we travelled in same school bus and I knew him as a senior . At that time, like many students, I was still trying to find my footing in the vast world of JEE preparation. With his calm demeanor, crystal-clear conceptual teaching, and question solving skills in Physics, he immediately made a lasting impression. A graduate with both B.Tech and M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, his academic background reflected in the clarity and depth with which he explained complex topics. Despite receiving coaching from other sources, it was his personal mentorship that helped me build a real foundation. We a batch of 8 students formed a very special bond both among ourselves and with Soumyadeep Dada. But my first attempt at JEE didn't go as expected. In that batch dada brought out 4 IITians, and I personally felt like I have let down dada with my performance in JEE ADVANCED. After my Class 12th results, I was disheartened and unsure of what to do next. It was during this diﬃcult phase that Er. Nandi didn’t just remain my teacher – he became my mentor and emotional anchor. He believed in me when I had begun to doubt myself. His words, his belief, and his strategy helped me decide to take a bold step — to repeat a year and give JEE another shot. Throughout my drop year, Er. Nandi was more involved than ever. He didn't just teach me Physics — he trained my mind to think, to stay calm under pressure, to focus on concepts rather than chasing problems mechanically. His methodical teaching, personalized guidance, motivational support, and ability to simplify the most abstract concepts were the pillars of my preparation.The result? I successfully secured an All India Rank of 12494 in JEE Advanced, and today, I am pursuing B.Tech in Mining Engineering at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. This achievement is not mine alone. It belongs equally to the man who walked every step of the way with me – not just a tutor, but a true mentor and a guide, Er. Soumyadeep Nandi. His contribution to my academic and personal growth is immeasurable, and I shall always remain grateful for his role in helping me reach where I am today.`,

    review: `During my JEE prep you played a great role not only by teaching me the concepts but also with support and care. your way of explaining complex concepts made even the most intimidating topics feel accessible. The best thing was the doubt solving, you were always available for the doubt solving and also the relatable examples from the regular life make the concepts easier to understand, even if I didn’t understand a topic you never got tired of explaining. You helped me not only like a teacher but more like a elder brother. What stood out the most was your encouragement—during times I struggled with self-doubt or couldn't solve a problem set, they reminded me that consistency mattered more than perfection. Looking back now, I realize that while books and practice are crucial, having a teacher who believes in you is also important.`,

    review: `When I think about my JEE Advanced journey, one name stands out — Soumyadeep Dada. He wasn't just a physics teacher; he was my Jeetu Bhaiya, an elder brother who genuinely cared about my success.

He had a rare gift of simplifying complex concepts and making physics intuitive. Beyond academics, he supported me emotionally, believed in me when I doubted myself, and treated us like younger siblings.

Dada didn’t just teach physics — he taught resilience, curiosity, and confidence. His guidance shaped not only my preparation, but also how I approach life.`,

    review: `The day Dada walked into Faction to take that one Physics session for KVPY — I didn’t know then, but everything changed for me. From that moment on, he wasn’t just a teacher. He became an elder brother, a mentor, and someone who made me believe I could achieve things I never even dared to dream of.

The day he told us to call him “Dada” instead of “Sir,” something shifted. He wasn’t standing on a pedestal anymore — he was sitting beside us, guiding us through. And the best part? He had gone through the same journey himself. He *knew* the struggle, the pressure, the fear — and that made all the difference. His advice wasn’t just theory; it came from lived experience.

JEE was a tough time. It drained us, filled us with doubt, and often made us question our worth. But having him by our side helped me not drown in all of it. Whether it was a concept I couldn’t understand or a breakdown I didn’t see coming — he handled both with the same calm. He was our true agony aunt in every sense — someone who just *got it*, and never made us feel less for slipping.

Somewhere along the way, I also found my tribe — a set of like-minded people, all working towards the same goal, without the drama, comparison, or pressure that usually surrounds this journey. He helped create that space.

Apart from my beautiful parents, no one has impacted my life the way he has. Thank you, Dada, for everything — for your time, your belief, your patience, and for changing my game when I needed it the most.`,
